This Code of AVL TREE has been done for our University Project (Usman Institute of Technology Karachi Pakistan).
The names of our group members are as follows:
Rizwan Khan Turk 17B-001-SE

Saddam Husssain 17B-055-SE.
In this project we have explained the working of AVL TREE that how it balances itself and checks its balance factor after each insertion
& deletion of Nodes.
To Use this you should create an object of class AVL and by using that object you can add elements in the tree and can also delete them.
After each insertion & deletion each element checks its balance factor.
The 4 rotations which balance a node are included in the code which are used whenever after insertion or deletion balancing is required 
so as to maintain the property of AVL Tree which is balance factor be either 0,-1 or 1.
After insertion of elements you can also search for the element presented in the tree aswell.
After each insertion/deletion balance factor checks itself and performs action if needed.
So Tree remains AVL because of this.
You can now Display your Tree in PreOrder,InOrder and PostOrder by using these methods to print the Tree according to the selected method.
Thank You for reading ! :)
